                <h4>Subscription Services</h4>
                <p>
                    All subscription purchases for LLM access, tools, or platform features on The SoftMax are billed in advance and are non-refundable, unless otherwise stated. Users can cancel at any time, and services will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle.
                </p>

                <h4>Pay-as-you-go Services</h4>
                <p>
                    For one-time or pay-per-use services (like API tokens or LLM queries), cancellations are not applicable once the service has been consumed or processed.
                </p>

                <h4>Trial Periods</h4>
                <p>
                    If a free trial is provided, you may cancel at any time before the trial period ends to avoid charges. After the trial, standard billing policies apply.
                </p>

                <h4>Refunds</h4>
                <p>
                    Refunds are only provided under the following conditions:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You were charged incorrectly due to a technical error.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You did not receive access to the service after successful payment.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Duplicate payments were made for the same account.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Refund requests must be submitted within 7 days of the transaction. We reserve the right to deny refund requests if we believe abuse of services has occurred.
                </p>
