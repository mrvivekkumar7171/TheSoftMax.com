## 🌍 Custom Domain Setup with Hostinger

To connect your GitHub Pages website with a custom domain purchased from Hostinger, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Configure DNS in Hostinger

1. Go to your Hostinger account and open the **DNS Zone Editor** for your domain.
2. Add or edit the following DNS records:

| Type | Name     | Value                         |
|------|----------|-------------------------------|
| A    | @        | `185.199.108.153`             |
| A    | @        | `185.199.109.153`             |
| A    | @        | `185.199.110.153`             |
| A    | @        | `185.199.111.153`             |
| CNAME | www    | `yourusername.github.io`       |

> Replace `yourusername.github.io` with your GitHub Pages username URL.

### Step 2: Add a CNAME File to GitHub

1. Inside your GitHub repository root, create a file named `CNAME`.
2. Add only your domain name (without `https://`) inside the file, for example:

```
thesoftmax.com
```

3. Commit and push this to your GitHub repo:

```bash
git add CNAME
git commit -m "Added custom domain"
git push
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository > **Settings** > **Pages**.
2. Under "Custom domain", enter `thesoftmax.com`.
3. Check the "Enforce HTTPS" option once the domain connects properly.

Your domain should now point to your GitHub Pages website!
