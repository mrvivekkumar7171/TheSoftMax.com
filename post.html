                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence (AI) models designed to understand, process, and generate human-like text. These models, built on deep learning architectures, particularly Transformer-based networks, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP). With applications ranging from chatbots and virtual assistants to content creation and code generation, LLMs are reshaping industries and redefining human-computer interaction.
                </p>

                <h4>Evolution of Large Language Models</h4>
                <p>
                    The journey of LLMs began with rule-based linguistic models and statistical language processing techniques. Early NLP models relied on hand-crafted rules and limited corpora. However, with the advent of machine learning, models like Word2Vec and GloVe introduced vector representations of words, improving the ability to capture contextual meaning. The true breakthrough came with Transformer-based architectures, first introduced in the paper Attention Is All You Need by Vaswani et al. in 2017. This innovation led to the development of state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s BERT and PaLM, Meta’s LLaMA, and Anthropic’s Claude.

                <h4>Architecture and Functionality</h4>
                <p>
                    At the core of LLMs lies the Transformer architecture, which employs self-attention mechanisms and parallel processing to analyze vast amounts of text efficiently. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process words sequentially, Transformers handle entire sequences at once, making them highly efficient for training on large datasets. LLMs are trained on diverse textual data, including books, articles, and web content, allowing them to develop a nuanced understanding of language, semantics, and context.
                </p>

                <p>A typical LLM undergoes two phases:</p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong>Pre-training:</strong> The model learns from massive text corpora in an unsupervised manner, predicting missing words or next words in a sequence.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> The model is further refined using supervised learning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), or domain-specific data to align with specific use cases.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><span>Applications of LLMs</span></h4>
