                <h4>How to Select a Project in Data Science?</h4>
                <p>Choosing the right project is one of the most critical aspects of starting your data science journey. Here’s how to approach it smartly:</p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li><strong>Don't be a specialist for your first job:</strong> Ensure your projects span across diverse domains and areas like NLP, Time-Series, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, ML, and GANs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Thinking:</strong> Treat your project like a real-world product. Think of every small detail, from concept to user interaction and deployment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose Relevant Use-Cases:</strong> Pick ideas with daily-life utility or industry popularity — like recommendation systems, fraud detection, or demand forecasting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select the Right Technology:</strong> Use popular tools and languages like Python, Jupyter, Flask, Streamlit, or AWS to make your project industry-aligned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recency Bias:</strong> Build projects around current trends or recent events (e.g., projects related to Olympics, COVID data, etc.) to capture attention.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How to Talk About Previous Data Science Projects in an Interview</h4>
                <p>It's not just about the work you’ve done — it's also about how you present it. Here's what to **avoid** and what to **do**:</p>

                <h5>Things Not to Do</h5>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>Never show irrelevant projects (make sure they match the job/role).</li>
                    <li>Don’t copy full projects from GitHub or other sources — originality matters.</li>
                    <li>Avoid overused datasets and projects like MNIST or Titanic.</li>
                    <li>Don’t sound unsure — you must confidently explain your work in 10–15 minutes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>How to Explain Your Project</h5>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is your project and why did you choose it? Was it born out of curiosity or a real problem you faced? how your product is different from others?</li>
                    <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> Explain your approach step by step — ideally with a flowchart or sketch on paper if available. Dive into data collection, cleaning, normalize, preprocessing, algorithm selection, feature engineering, product development, and deployment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Include how you served your solution — via a website, app, Chrome extension, APIs, CI/CD pipeline, AWS deployment, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Mention the challenges, what you learned, the project’s impact (quantify if possible), and how you'd improve it next time.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How to Get Your First Job in Data Science</h4>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li><strong>Why do you want the job?</strong> Have a clear motivation beyond just "getting hired."</li>
                    <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Rejections are normal — sometimes it takes 30–40 interviews before you land a job.</li>
                    <li><strong>Widen your reach:</strong> Apply across platforms, especially lesser-known ones. Directly message professionals and HRs, and keep your LinkedIn and GitHub active.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>If your resume isn’t getting selected</h5>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>Apply beyond popular sites like Naukri — try IIT-hosted job boards, career pages of companies, and cold emails to recruiters.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>If you're getting rejected in interviews</h5>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>Strengthen your technical skills. Revisit the questions you failed. Keep practicing.</li>
                    <li>Ask for feedback after each interview to identify improvement areas.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>If soft skills are weak</h5>
                <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                    <li>Practice interviews. Join mock interviews or attend communication workshops.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can also boost your chances by participating in hackathons, which sometimes directly lead to job offers. Internships and postgraduate studies (AI, ML, Deep Learning) can also serve as alternate entry points.</p>
