<!-- How to select a project in Data Science?

    - Don't be a specialist for first job (all project must be in different domain and topics like NLP, Time-series and Computer Vision, Deep Learning, ML, GANS etc.)
    - Project Thinking (like a actual product not just a project and every small detail of it)
    - Choose Relevant Products that comes in daily life and use case like (recommendation system or any topic that are mostly used in the industry)
    - Choose Right Technology that are mostly used like python etc.
    - Recency Bias (value recent thing most then past things so make project related to recent event to get attention like Olampic etc. )

How to Talk about previous Data Science projects in the Interview?
    Things not to do!
    - Never show irrelevant project (according to job and company requirement)
    - Never fully copy the project from github and any other source.
    - Project must not be too much common like MNIST etc.

    - What is your project and why you made this (interest or problem you face solution)?
    - how you build the project step by step (explain the flow chart/draw on paper if available, then dive into details (data, approach/algorithm/feature engineering, how you convert this into product, data cleaning, normalize, how your product is different from others. how to server the user using website, app or chrome plugin etc. api, server, ci/cd pipeline, aws deployment etc.) ).
    - what challenge you faced and what you have learned, impact of the project (in numbers if possible), improvements you can do?

    participate in hackthon and sometime you can also get job if you score well 
    go for internship from there you can also go to full time
