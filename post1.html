    - Famous Examples:- Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Oracle etc.


Difference between Open Source and closed source:- Source Code, Price, Development Process, Service Component, Usability, Security etc.


Why you should contribute to Open Source? :- Gain Industry Experience, Learning, Profile Building, Networking, People Skills, Joy of giving etc.


How you can contribute to an Open Source Project
    - Coding based Contribution :- Adding new features, Bug-fixing, Automate Project setup, Improve tooling and testing, Review others code etc.
    - Non-coding based Contributions :- Writing Documentation, Writing Tutorials, Mentoring Contributors, Answering Projects, Organize events/promotions etc.


Required Skill for Open Source Contribution :- 
    - Tangible Skills :- Programming, Version Control, Tech stack (full data science) etc.
    - Non-tangible skills :- Hacker Mindset (think new features), Thick skinned (work even if your contribution not accepted), People skills (how to communicate) etc.

    - Contributing :- These are guidelines that help people who contribute to the project know exactly what is expected from them
    - Documentation :- A detailed description of the code in the software
    - Code of Conduct :- A written set of rules on how everyone should behave while collaborating on the project

Mostly Open Source Software are hosted on GitHub like https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn. Visit Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Projects etc. to help with contribution.
